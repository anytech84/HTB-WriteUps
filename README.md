# Hack The Box

Hack The Box is an online platform allowing you to test your penetration testing skills and exchange ideas and methodologies with other members of similar interests. It contains several challenges that are constantly updated. Some of them simulating real world scenarios and some of them leaning more towards a CTF style of challenge.

In this repository, I will be documenting my journey through the platform. I will be solving machines, challenges, sherlocks and pro labs. I will also be writing writeups for the same.

## Machines 

Machines are the main part of Hack The Box. They are virtual machines loaded with a variety of vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. The goal is to gain root access and read the flag file.
Every week, a new machine is released and the older one is retired. There are always 20 active machines available on the platform.

## Challenges 

Challenges are smaller than machines but still require some effort to complete. They are divided into different categories such as :
- AI - ML
- Blockchain
- Cryptography
- Forensics
- GamePwn
- Hardware
- Misc
- Mobile
- OSINT
- Pwn
- Reversing
- Web

## Sherlocks

Sherlocks are challenges specially designed for Blue Teamers. They are designed to test your skills in detecting and preventing attacks.
They are divided into different categories such as :
- Cloud
- DFIR
- Malware Analysis
- SOC
- Threat Intelligence

## Pro Labs

Pro Labs are dedicated environments for practicing and mastering specific skills. They are designed to be more realistic than the machines and challenges on the public platform. They are also more difficult and require a lot of effort to complete.
